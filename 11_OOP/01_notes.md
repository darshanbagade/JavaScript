# Javacript and Classes

- In JavaScript, there are classes, but they are internally made using prototypes.

## OOP

## Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## Why use OOP
- we can use more features
- we can use services

## parts of OOPs
Object Literals
- Constructor Function 
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Intances (new, this)

## Four Pillars

- Abstraction
    - Showing only neccessary data
- Encapsulation
    - Hiding internal details.
- Inheritance
    - Reusing properties and methods from another class.
- Polymorphism
    -  Using a single interface for different data types
